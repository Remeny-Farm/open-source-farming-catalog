# Keeper Collar — Design (PROPOSAL, not printed)

The one new load-bearing part. A two-piece PETG ring that clips around the
assembled tag, locks the cap against turning open, and carries the quarter-turn
bayonet every accessory mounts on. Fits the unmodified Rev B tag.

## Cross-section (at a tab azimuth → window; elsewhere the wall is closed)

## How it holds — four constraints, none touching the closure

| Constraint | Feature | Load path |
|---|---|---|
| Rotation (its own) | two windows keyed on the 13.0 mm tabs (13.40 opening) | collar → tab flanks → body |
| Rotation (the cap's) | bonus only: spring finger clicking into a stock 0.25 grip scallop | cap → finger → collar → body |
| Down | support pads on the tab shoulder ledges at z = 2.20; deck lip 0.15 over the cap face | collar → tabs |
| Up | **bottom bead in a 0.5-deep lateral groove on the body's flange OD** (`body_platform` variant) | collar → groove → **body** → harness |

**Design corrections (2026-08-30).** (1) The Rev B tag has no upward-facing
undercut anywhere — deliberately snag-free — so friction alone cannot retain
the collar for deployment. (2) A first fix grooved the **cap** OD; rejected,
because the personalised transparent cap must never be modified or replaced.
The groove therefore lives on the **body flange** (z −0.55…0.00, root
r 15.47), and the collar wall now reaches down to z −0.60 — still 0.40 mm
above the floor plane, so the collar never touches the hen. The bead enters
the groove **laterally** as the clamshell closes: no snap-over, no flexing,
zero-fatigue positive lock, and all accessory loads bypass the cap closure
entirely — the original cap-opening concern dissolves. Machine-verified in
`../cad/hen_tag_platform.py`: body variant removes 30.1 mm³ / adds 0.0 mm³;
collar interference 0.000 mm³ vs. grooved body and vs. cap; lowest collar
point +0.40 mm above the floor plane. Existing (ungrooved) bodies take the
collar in friction-only mode for bench work; deployment wants the grooved
body, swapped at a battery service with the personal cap carried over.

The deck lip stops at r 15.55 — 0.15 mm outside the lettering band (≤ r 15.4),
so id, message and heart remain fully visible. The clear LED ring (r 8.5–11.5)
is nowhere near the collar.

Service order is forced and is a safety feature: **accessory off → collar
open → cap off**. The clamshell latch sits on the crown deck under the
bayonet ring, so a mounted accessory physically covers it; and the collar must
come off before the cap can be serviced, so the cap can never be opened by
anything that got past the accessory.

## Dimensions

| Feature | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Bore over skirt | r 16.22 (fit 0.25) | same class as `fit_lug_r` |
| Wall | 1.55 mm (r 16.22–17.77) | ≥3 perimeters at 0.4 nozzle |
| Collar OD | **35.54 mm** | still inside the 40.14 tab span |
| Height | z −0.60 → 11.65 (12.25 mm part) | bead zone to bayonet top; lowest point 0.40 above the floor plane |
| Crown deck | z 8.85–10.05 (t 1.20) | 0.15 clearance over cap face |
| Bayonet ring | r 16.2–17.8, 1.6 tall, on deck | see `accessories.md` |
| Rim lip | inner r 15.55, 0.55 engagement, 0.60 t | over the rim bevel |
| Windows | 2 ×, 13.40 wide, full height below deck | tab + elastic clearance |
| Support pads | 4 ×, ~1.8 × 2.0, land z 2.20 | on the ledges beside slot ends (slot is 8.8 long in a 13.0 tab → 2.1 mm ledge each side) |
| Retention bead | z −0.45…−0.10, 0.35 radial engagement, 0.10 axial play each way | mates the body flange groove |
| Spring finger | R1.2 bump, 0.30 proud, clicks a stock 0.25 scallop | bonus cap lock only |
| Mass | ~2.2 g (estimate, verify on scale) | PETG 1.27 g/cm³ |

## Two-piece clamshell

Two 180° halves, parting plane on the tab axis (through the windows). Each
half ends in a bridge over a window at deck level; the halves join there:
dovetail rail + a snap latch released by twisting a flat blade in a slot on
the deck top. Closing the halves preloads the bore onto the skirt (target
0.10–0.15 mm diametral interference → the friction component of the cap lock).

Why clamshell instead of one flexible ring: no ovalizing strain on layer
lines (PETG snap-fit L/t limits), each half prints in a strong orientation,
and mounting never drags anything across the O-ring, cap face or elastic.

Print: halves standing, parting face down candidates — decide at slicing; the
latch hook must load in compression, not layer peel. Layer 0.16, 3 perimeters,
same profile as the enclosure.

## Failure modes considered

- **Peck on the collar edge**: all outer edges ≥1 mm radius; the lip and deck
  overhang ≤0.6 mm — nothing a beak can get under.
- **Latch failure**: halves are individually captive on the tabs (windows) and
  under the lip; a failed latch loosens the clamp but the collar cannot leave
  the tag as one piece, and halves cannot slide off past the tabs. Degraded,
  not detached. Daily check catches it.
- **Torque overload** (snag on mesh, another hen): routed to tab flanks — the
  tab root carries harness load in tension across 13 mm already; torque adds
  shear at the same section. Bench item; if marginal, Rev C pad seats spread it.
- **Dirt trap** between wall and skirt: 0.25 gap, open at the windows; collar
  is removed at every battery service and is a cheap reprint — replace when
  soiled rather than scrub (FDM biofilm rule).

## Fit coupon

`coupon_collar`: a 120° wall segment (bore, bottom bead, spring finger,
deck + lip, bayonet blank), ~15 min print, mating `coupon_flangering` — a base
slice of the grooved body. Both are generated and exported by
`../cad/hen_tag_platform.py`. Settles bore fit and bead click before
committing to full halves — same philosophy as the closure coupons in
`../DESIGN.md`.

## UNVERIFIED

Everything. Specifically: skirt OD as-printed (design 31.94; Rev A printed
thread was confirmed, skirt OD was not measured), scallop depth as-printed,
cap break-loose torque, tab shear under torque, PETG clamp relaxation over
weeks outdoors, RF effect (antenna unknown).

## Full collar, bench prototype v1 (2026-09-25)

`../cad/collar_full.py` builds the whole collar: two clamshell halves
(`collar_half_a`, `collar_half_b`) plus a demo accessory (`halo_accessory`).
Machine checks: 0.000 mm³ interference against `body_platform`, the cap, each
other, and the halo at both entry and seated positions. The lowest collar point
is 0.55 mm above the floor plane. The pair weighs 2.55 g and the halo 0.77 g.
Nothing has been printed yet.

v1 prints support-free, upright, as installed. `../cad/overhang.py` reports
only bridges (window top 13.4 mm, slot roof 2.1 mm) and overhangs under 1 mm
(deck lip 0.67, bayonet channel roof 0.95). v0 was rejected on the bench
because its joint pegs, shoulder pads and accessory lugs floated above the bed.
The changes that differ from the design above:

- **Parting plane on x = 0, between the tabs.** Each half carries one whole
  tab window and closes along X.
- **Joint:** a vertical tongue standing on the bed (+Y end) slides into a
  bottom-open slot (-Y end), with a vertical detent rib. There is no blade
  latch yet.
- **No support pads.** They floated 2.8 mm above the bed. The deck lip over
  the cap rim and the bead in the flange groove carry the vertical load.
- **Bead flush with the bed.** The wall now starts at the bead's lower face
  (z −0.45).
- **Bayonet:** a 2.4 mm ring (a 1.6 mm ring leaves no roof over a lug channel),
  45° travel and channels open down to the deck, so accessory lugs share the
  accessory's bed face. The detent is a radial bump at the channel root.
- **Edges are not yet radiused.** Every edge needs ≥ 1 mm before any hen
  wears it.
