# Hen Tag Enclosure

Parametric, 3D-printed enclosure for the Remeny Farm hen tag: a small
BLE activity tag worn by free-range laying hens under the farm's hen-patron
program. This repository holds the mechanical design only — the parametric
[build123d](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/) CAD source, the verification
and per-tag cap generators, and the physical evidence gathered from printing
and fitting it — as real solid-body CAD (STEP as well as STL), not a dead
triangle mesh.

## Hardware context

The tag is built around a **Holyiot 25008** module (Nordic **nRF54L15** SoC,
ST **LIS2DH12** accelerometer) powered by a **CR2032** coin cell. It is worn
by the hen on a figure-eight elastic harness through the enclosure's in-plane
side tabs, assembled and installed by farm staff following the documented
procedure. The electronics and firmware live in a separate, private
repository; this repository covers the mechanical enclosure only.

The design is welfare-first: the current (Revision B) model lands at
**10.92 g assembled**, conductive/carbon-fibre filament is strictly
prohibited (it detunes the 2.4 GHz antenna and creates an ESD/short hazard
against the exposed coin-cell terminals), and every geometry decision is
checked against interference, wall thickness and printability before it is
considered done. See [`docs/requirements.md`](docs/requirements.md) for the
full material and welfare-adjacent requirements this design has to satisfy.

## Goals

- **Durable, hen-safe enclosure** — a sealed transparent PETG housing (radial
  O-ring, target IP54-level dust/splash protection — not yet tested), no
  conductive filament, and a mass budget held close to a 10 g target.
- **Per-hen customizable cap** — [`cad/cap_marking.py`](cad/cap_marking.py)
  generates a deterministic, per-hen cap (id number, an optional short
  message, an icon) and exports it straight to a ready-to-slice, multi-colour
  Bambu Studio project.
- **Accessory platform** — [`platform/`](platform/) proposes a keeper collar
  and bayonet mount so decorative and functional accessories can be added
  without ever modifying or replacing the shipping cap. Proposal stage, open
  for contribution.
- **Community contributions** — parametric, machine-verified, test-covered
  source with dated physical lab notes and explicit verified-vs-unverified
  labeling, so outside contributors have a real basis to trust and extend the
  design. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Per-hen cap customisation

Patrons choose a colour scheme, an icon or a centre pattern and a top-band
pattern for their hen's cap in the app and lock the design; staff batch one
scheme's locked caps onto one printer plate. Design and requirements:
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-hen-cap-customisation-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-hen-cap-customisation-design.md).

```sh
cd cad
uv run --python 3.12 cap_marking.py 67 --icon sun --band dots     # one cap with a band pattern
uv run --python 3.12 cap_batch.py fixtures/batch_sample.json       # batch JSON -> plate + manifest + proofs
cd ../editor && pnpm install && pnpm dev                            # the patron editor prototype
```

- [`cad/catalog.json`](cad/catalog.json) is the source of truth for the
  colour schemes (base + two free colours, Prusament Clear window; five on
  offer since 2026-09-18, three retired ones kept printable for designs
  already locked on them), the packs (basic free, vibe 50, drop 300–1000
  limited, priced per item), 34 icons, 16 patterns, the five colour zones
  (a translucent filament may not go on the opaque ring or number) and the
  fees; the app ships an identical copy.
  [`cad/cap_motifs.py`](cad/cap_motifs.py) holds every motif as parametric
  geometry, [`cad/check_motifs.py`](cad/check_motifs.py) proves them printable.
- [`cad/cap_batch.py`](cad/cap_batch.py) turns the admin's batch JSON into
  `plate_<batch>_P1S.3mf` (6 × 6, up to 36 caps, AMS 1 clear / 2 text /
  3 accent, print settings baked in), a manifest and a proof SVG per cap.
  A 36-cap plate slices to 36 objects in an estimated 4 h 13 m
  ([lab note](docs/lab/2026-09-14-cap-batch-plate.md)); **no plate has been
  printed yet.**
- [`editor/`](editor/) is the drop-in patron editor built with chirp's own
  UI package; see its README for how it maps into the chirp repository.

## Quickstart

Both CAD scripts carry [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline
dependencies, so `uv` resolves everything (build123d, bd_warehouse) on first
run. No virtualenv, nothing installed into the repository.

```sh
cd cad

# Build the enclosure and export STEP + STL to out/
uv run --python 3.12 hen_tag_enclosure.py

# 39 machine checks (interference, fit, bayonet, wall thickness, seal, harness) + half sections
uv run --python 3.12 verify.py

# Generate one hen's cap: id, optional message, icon
uv run --python 3.12 cap_marking.py 67 --top "Bözsi!" --icon heart

# Generator test suite (add --bambu for the full Bambu Studio export path)
uv run --python 3.12 test_cap_marking.py

# Real-slicer check: warnings + travels over open air (needs Bambu Studio)
uv run --python 3.12 slice_check.py

# Bambu Studio project with all four parts and the print settings baked in
uv run --python 3.12 slice_check.py --project   # -> out/hen_tag_revC_P1S.3mf
```

First run downloads the OCCT wheel (~60 MB) and a CPython 3.12 toolchain;
after that it is cached. `verify.py` exits non-zero on any failed check, so
it works as a pre-commit or CI gate. See [`cad/README.md`](cad/README.md)
for the full command reference, including re-checking a part against the
real slicer.

## Print settings

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Material | Transparent PETG | Impact resistance, UV stability, low moisture absorption; keeps the LED and lettering readable. |
| Nozzle | 0.40 mm | Thinnest wall in the design is 0.80 mm = 2 perimeters. |
| Layer height | 0.16 mm | The bayonet ramps and the O-ring groove need the resolution. |
| Perimeters | 3 | The bayonet lips make the skirt 5 lines thick in places. |
| Wall generator | **Arachne** | Variable-width walls absorb the lips as walls, not infill islands. |
| Avoid crossing walls | **On** | Routes travels over the print, not across the open bore; without it PETG strings the bore (58 → 3 crossing travels on the cap coupon). |
| Infill | 30 %+ | Parts are nearly all perimeter anyway. |
| Supports | None | Verified by slicing — all four parts return `Success.` with zero warnings. |
| Orientation | Already baked into the exported STLs | Drop them on the plate as-is; re-orienting the cap turns its top plate into a ~28 mm bridge. |

Or skip the settings altogether: [`cad/out/hen_tag_revC_P1S.3mf`](cad/out/hen_tag_revC_P1S.3mf)
is a Bambu Studio project with the four printables on one P1S plate and every
setting above already applied — open, slice, print.

Full rationale, tolerances and the slicer verification log are in
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#print-settings).

## Design highlights

- **Radial seal, not an axial face seal** — the O-ring seals on a bore
  diameter instead of a compressed flange, which also removes ~1.7 g of pure
  overhead. [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#1-radial-seal-not-the-axial-face-seal)
- **Bayonet closure below the seal** — three lugs and self-locking helical
  ramps replace a thread whose ridges were thinner than one extrusion; every
  face on both parts prints without support, and the O-ring never crosses the
  lugs. [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#9-bayonet-not-a-thread)
- **Three-colour coin cap** — a deterministic per-hen cap with coin-style
  bent lettering, an accent-ring icon, and a clear shell so the LED needs no
  aligned window. [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#8-customer-cap-clear-shell-big-coin-lettering-accent-core)
- **Flat underside** — verified at 0.000 mm³ of material below the floor
  plane, so nothing presses on the hen but the harness itself.
  [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#7-in-plane-side-tabs-for-the-harness)
- **In-plane side tabs** — the harness elastic wraps a bar on two flat tabs
  in the plane of the base, which is what makes the flat underside possible.
  [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#7-in-plane-side-tabs-for-the-harness)

## Status

**v1 is Revision C geometry.** It is machine-verified — 39 checks in
`cad/verify.py`, all passing — but that is a claim about the model, not about
a worn device:

- **Revision A** was printed and fitted on a Bambu Lab P1S: dimensions good,
  and its thread mated on that one pair. Later caps tore along the thread,
  whose ridges compute to less than one extrusion wide, so revision C
  replaced it with a bayonet.
- **Revision B's body** has also been printed and accepted the board in its
  intended orientation, and revision B sliced clean in Bambu Studio.
- **Revision C's bayonet** slices clean and its coupon pair has been printed
  once: dimensions good, lock-up angle not yet reported. The full cap, the
  complete sealed assembly and the harness tabs under load remain untested —
  no O-ring has been compressed, no water has touched it, and no elastic has
  loaded a tab.
- **No hen has worn this device.**

See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#verified-evidence-vs-working-hypotheses) for the
full verified-vs-unverified breakdown and the open questions blocking the
next print.

## Animal welfare

The tag is worn continuously by a live animal, so mass and fit are treated as
hard constraints, not just engineering targets. At ~10.9 g assembled the
device is a small fraction of a laying hen's typical body mass — well inside
commonly cited bio-logging guidance of keeping an attached device under
roughly 3 % of body mass — though `DESIGN.md` is explicit that whether the
project's own 10 g figure is a hard welfare limit or a design aspiration is
still an open decision, not yet resolved. The design avoids magnets, sharp
edges and anything a beak could catch or detach; production tags are
assembled and fitted by farm staff, with daily visual checks as part of
normal husbandry. This is not a consumer product for end users to assemble
or fit themselves.

## Accessory platform

[`platform/`](platform/) is a **design proposal**, not a shipping feature:
nothing in it has been printed or tested, and the current shipping design
(`DESIGN.md`, `cad/hen_tag_enclosure.py`) is untouched by it. It describes a
keeper collar and quarter-turn bayonet mount for a family of accessories —
decorative rings, villa-only builds, a mesh saddle — without ever modifying
the personalised cap. It is open for contribution; see
[`platform/README.md`](platform/README.md) for the architecture and
[`platform/accessories.md`](platform/accessories.md) for the hard safety
envelope every accessory design must satisfy.
