# Enclosure CAD

Parametric source for the hen tag enclosure. Solid B-rep modelling via
[build123d](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/) on the OCCT kernel, so the output
is real CAD geometry with true fillets and helical sweeps, exported as **STEP as well
as STL** — the model stays editable in FreeCAD or any other CAD tool rather than
being a dead triangle mesh.

## Running

Both scripts carry PEP 723 inline dependencies, so `uv` resolves everything on
first run. No virtualenv, and nothing is installed into the repository.

```sh
uv run --python 3.12 hen_tag_enclosure.py   # build + export to out/
uv run --python 3.12 verify.py              # 39 machine checks + half sections (+9 with --board-step)
uv run --python 3.12 slice_check.py         # real-slicer check, needs Bambu Studio
```

First run downloads the OCCT wheel (~60 MB) and a CPython 3.12 toolchain; after
that it is cached. `verify.py` exits non-zero when a check fails, so it works as
a pre-commit or CI gate.

**STLs are exported already lying in their print orientation** — the cap and the
female coupon are flipped top-plate-down on export. Drop them on the plate as
they are; re-orienting the cap makes its top plate a ~28 mm bridge. The STEP
files keep the design coordinate system so the model stays readable in CAD.

`slice_check.py` re-checks printability against the real slicer: it runs the
Bambu Studio CLI on the four printables with the P1S 0.4 mm machine, the
0.16 mm process, PETG Basic, and the three settings `../DESIGN.md` asks for
(3 walls, Arachne, avoid crossing walls), then reads the G-code back and
counts travel moves that fly across open air — the bore of the cap, the cavity
and cell pocket of the body — where PETG leaves a string. It fails on a slicer
warning or when a count exceeds a limit set just above the 2026-09-10 numbers.
`--stock` slices with the untouched Bambu profile for comparison, `--keep`
leaves the G-code in `out/slice/`. Skips with exit 0 when Bambu Studio is not
installed.

## Per-tag cap markings — the deterministic tag generator

```sh
uv run --python 3.12 cap_marking.py 67 --top "Bözsi!" --icon heart
uv run --python 3.12 cap_marking.py 12345 --icon star
uv run --python 3.12 cap_marking.py 133 --icon flower --font tahoma
uv run --python 3.12 test_cap_marking.py            # test suite; --bambu for the full path
```

This is the back end for the customer design UI. The inputs are exactly the
customer-facing choices, everything else is fixed:

| Input | Envelope |
|---|---|
| number | **required**, 1–5 digits, bottom arc, 6.0 pt |
| `--top` message | ALL CAPS coin lettering at 5.2 pt; letters incl. Hungarian (ő/ű), digits, space, `.:!?'"+-`; **guaranteed-safe length: 8 characters** (all-'W' worst case), typical texts fit ~11–13 — over-length is rejected with the measured span |
| `--icon` | `heart` / `star` / `flower` / `none` — parametric shapes in the centre |
| `--font` | curated list: verdana (default), tahoma, arial, futura, din, rounded |

**Layout (second print-driven revision): the whole shell is CLEAR PETG.** The
first trial printed the lettering at a 2.9 mm band and it was unreadable, and
the product look wanted a transparent body anyway. With the shell clear, the
dedicated LED window disappears — the LED shines through wherever it lands, so
there is nothing to align — and the lettering band grows to ~6 mm: double the
letter height, at the price of a shorter message. The centre is a full
**accent disc** (Ø17.2) in the third colour with the icon cut out of it and
inlaid in the text colour — the two colours meet edge to edge, no clear gap.

| Slot | Body | Filament |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cap_<n>` | the whole shell — **clear PETG** |
| 2 | `marking_<n>` | lettering + icon, text colour (0.64 mm flush inlay) |
| 3 | `core_<n>` | accent disc, the icon cut from it (0.64 mm flush inlay) |

Deterministic by design: **font sizes are fixed**, misfits are rejected with
measured numbers, and identical input produces **byte-identical** output
(canonically ordered welded meshes, deterministic STL writer, fixed zip
timestamps) — a regenerated tag can be diffed against a shipped one.

Envelope rules the test suite forced: the message is uppercased (a lowercase
descender plus an accented capital outgrows any printable band height, while
accented capitals alone fit), and comma/semicolon/parentheses are excluded
from the charset for the same below-the-baseline reason.

The deliverable for the P1S is **`out/cap_<n>_P1S.3mf`** — a Bambu Studio
project with the three bodies as parts of ONE object (`--assemble` via the
Bambu CLI, so nothing can be arranged apart or dragged out of register) and
the filament slots pre-assigned. Open it, load the project settings, put clear
PETG in AMS slot 1, the text colour in 2, the accent colour in 3, slice. Each
part's `extruder` is patched into `Metadata/model_settings.config`, the
assembler's per-part recentring is undone with measured translations, and the
result is verified numerically against the source solids plus round-tripped
through the CLI. Needs `/Applications/BambuStudio.app`; without it only the
vendor-neutral `cap_<n>.3mf` + per-part STLs are written (assign filaments by
hand in other slicers).

Because the cap prints top-plate-down, all three bodies meet in the first
layers against the plate; the outer face comes out as one smooth plane. There
is no clear layer over or under the inlays — the first layer is already the
final colour. A washed-out colour means the coloured PETG itself is
translucent at 0.64 mm: deepen with `--depth` (up to 0.80) at the cost of
thinner cover above.

The 3MF is written by the script itself: one mesh object per body (libraries
explode the glyphs into a dozen objects), tessellation **welded** (OCCT
duplicates vertices per face; 3MF importers trust the index buffer and the
cracks sliced into "floating region" warnings) and refused if any non-manifold
edge remains. Lettering defaults to **Verdana** with the full Hungarian glyph
set; hairline strokes are lifted by dilation and any printable feature under
0.58 mm is refused. Icons are parametric geometry, no emoji fonts. The cap's
closure, seal and envelope are untouched — `build_cap()` is imported, not
copied.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `hen_tag_enclosure.py` | All geometry. `Params` at the top holds every dimension. |
| `catalog.json` | Schemes, icons, centre/band patterns and fees a patron may choose; the app ships a copy, `test_cap_marking.py` keeps them identical. |
| `cap_design.py` | Catalog loader, `design_hash` (v2, with zone colours), `validate_design` (zone rules incl. no translucent filament on an opaque zone; retired schemes stay valid), `lock_price`; no build123d, shared by the batch CLI and the tests. |
| `cap_motifs.py` | Every icon and pattern as a parametric sketch (34 icons, 3 centre, 13 band patterns; the barcode band is seeded by the serial). |
| `check_motifs.py` | Printability of the whole motif library (erosion/dilation, extents) plus a contact sheet (`--svg`). |
| `cap_svg.py` | Sketch → SVG: `out/layout.json` for the app preview, proof SVGs for the batch. |
| `bambu_project.py` | Pure-Python Bambu Studio plate writer (6 × 6 grid, part extruders, settings template in `bambu/`). |
| `cap_batch.py` | Batch JSON → plate, manifest, proofs; caches bodies per design hash; runs `slice_check.py` on the plate. |
| `test_bambu_project.py`, `test_cap_batch.py` | Writer and batch suites (structure, determinism, refusals, a real slice). |
| `verify.py` | Interference, fit, bayonet, wall thickness, seal and harness checks. |
| `slice_check.py` | Real-slicer check: warnings and open-air travel counts per part; `--project` writes the ready-to-print Bambu project. Needs Bambu Studio. |
| `out/hen_tag_revC_P1S.3mf` | Bambu Studio project: body, cap and both coupons on one P1S plate, print settings baked in. |
| `cap_marking.py` | Deterministic per-tag cap generator (number, message, icon, font). |
| `test_cap_marking.py` | Generator test suite: envelope, rejections, determinism. |
| `out/body.stl` / `.step` | Main housing. |
| `out/cap.stl` / `.step` | Bayonet cap. |
| `out/coupon_*.stl` | Bayonet + groove fit coupons. Print these first: the bayonet has not been printed anywhere yet. |
| `out/section_*.stl` | Half sections, for looking at the internals only. |

## Changing dimensions

Every dimension lives in the `Params` dataclass. Derived values — groove depth,
lug and lip stations, cap diameter, Z stations — are computed properties, so changing
one input propagates correctly instead of leaving stale constants behind.

The values most likely to need correcting, all currently UNVERIFIED:

```python
holder_h   = 4.0    # holder + seated cell, off the PCB face (board itself: STEP)
oring_cs   = 1.50   # measure the ring you actually have
strap_w    = 8.80   # slot length; measure the elastic you actually have
strap_t    = 1.80   # slot width, along the spine
foam_t     = 2.0    # foam ring over a 1.79 mm gap to the board face
```

Board orientation is **holder down, PCB up** — the LED has to look out through
the cap, not at the bird. `cell_fill()` builds the crescent that retains the
holder; `strap_tabs()` builds the in-plane side tabs; `body_lugs()` and
`cap_channels()` build the two halves of the bayonet, both from one helical
sweep helper so their bearing faces share a pitch.

### Batch workflow

1. The app's admin page downloads a `hen-cap-batch/1` JSON: one scheme, up to
   36 locked caps (serial, icon *or* centre pattern, band pattern, design
   hash, hen name). `fixtures/batch_sample.json` is the shape.
2. `uv run --python 3.12 cap_batch.py <batch.json>` refuses the whole batch on
   any problem (schema, `generator_version` ≠ `catalog.json`, unknown ids,
   icon + centre together, a zone colour rule, a translucent filament on the
   ring or number, duplicate serial, bad hash, > 36 caps; a retired scheme is
   accepted) and lists
   every offending cap; otherwise it writes `out/plates/plate_<id>_P1S.3mf`,
   `plate_<id>_manifest.csv` (`position,serial,hen_name,design_hash`,
   positions `1A`…`6F`) and `proof/<design_hash>.svg`, then slices the plate
   through Bambu Studio and reports objects, warnings and the time estimate.
3. Open the plate in Bambu Studio, set AMS 1 = the scheme's base filament,
   2 = Prusament PETG Clear, 3 = colour a, 4 = colour b (`catalog.json` names
   them; the batch CLI prints the mapping), print. The plate carries the
   `Bambu PETG Basic @BBL X1C` preset in all four slots whatever the scheme
   (Prusament, Bambu PETG Basic, or Bambu PETG Translucent in `lavender`'s
   slot 4): the per-filament arrays stay as exported (see
   `bambu_project.py`): temperatures and flow come from that preset, the
   AMS mapping on the printer decides which spool feeds each slot. Whether
   PETG Translucent prints well on the Basic preset is UNVERIFIED.
4. Upload the proofs to the app (file name = design hash).

Patterns must survive a 0.4 mm erosion (feature ≥ 0.8 mm) and a 0.4 mm
dilation without islands merging (gap ≥ 0.8 mm), and every inlay together must
leave ≥ 60 % of the LED ring (r 8.5–11.5) clear; `cap_marking.py` checks all
three. Band patterns live in a fixed window (−10°…190°) that clears a 5-digit
serial by 22°.

After any change, re-run `verify.py` before printing. It is what caught the
assembly-path defect described in `../DESIGN.md`.

## Bayonet fit

Print the coupons and note where the cap stops turning freely. Nominal is 30°
clockwise from the entry slots; anywhere from about 5° to 55° still locks. Then
adjust and regenerate — do not file the parts:

```python
cam_lock   = 30.0   # deg of rotation to nominal contact: raise if it locks early, lower if late
fit_lug_r  = 0.15   # radial clearance, lug crest to channel root: raise if the lugs bind
fit_lug_z  = 0.30   # axial clearance, lug top to channel ceiling
cam_rate   = 0.012  # ramp rise per degree; lower for a longer, softer tightening
```

Note for anyone extending this: the cap is modelled in its **locked** pose, so
the cap solid is already the assembled one. `verify.py` turns it back toward
the entry angle (`pose(phi)`) to prove the drop-on, the free run and the wedge.
Lugs and lips are swept along helices of the same pitch; change `cam_rate` and
both follow.
