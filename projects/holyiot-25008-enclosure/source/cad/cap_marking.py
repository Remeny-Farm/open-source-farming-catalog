Deterministic by design: font sizes are FIXED (no content-dependent
shrinking), inputs that do not fit are rejected with measured numbers, and the
same input always yields byte-identical output. Customer-facing inputs:
number (1-5 digits, required), short message (charset- and length-checked),
icon (heart / star / flower / none), font (curated list). See
test_cap_marking.py for the accepted envelope.

Three bodies, three filaments, one file: out/cap_<n>.3mf

    cap_<n>       the whole shell in CLEAR PETG -- the LED (r 10, angle
                  uncontrolled) shines through wherever it lands, so no
                  window part and no angular alignment at all
    marking_<n>   the lettering and the icon, in the customer's text colour
    core_<n>      an accent ring (r 6.6..8.6) framing the icon, third colour

Layout, viewed from outside (coin convention):

                . . B Ö Z S I !  . .          <- top arc, big caps
             /                      \

                ' ' '  6 7  ' ' '             <- bottom arc, big digits

A print trial killed the previous opaque-shell + clear-LED-ring layout: the
2.9 mm lettering was unreadable. With the shell clear, the lettering band
runs from the accent core to the scallops (r 9.6..15.55, ~6 mm tall), the
digits are 6.0 pt and the message 5.2 pt caps -- roughly twice the printed
letter height, at the price of a shorter message.

    mesh is not connected at all. STL importers weld on load; 3MF importers
    take the index buffer at its word, and the resulting hairline cracks slice
    into slivers that the slicer reports as floating regions.

    Canonical order: OCCT meshes faces in parallel, so the same geometry comes
    back with a different triangle order on every run. Sorting vertices and
    triangles (rotation-normalised, winding preserved) makes the serialised
    mesh reproducible byte for byte.
